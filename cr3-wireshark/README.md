Crimson v3 Wireshark Protocol Dissector
=======================================

This is a repository for a Wireshark dissector for the Crimson v3 protocol
related to the ICS HMI touchpanels made by Red Lion Controls (http://redlion.net). 
These devices support updates over TCP port 789. This minimal dissector is a
starting point for understanding this protocol.
